------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
From this assignment, I now understand the math class method in Java better. 
I made the mistake of using an array at first until I double checked the project instructions
and realized I could not use an array so this project took me a lot longer than expected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
Next time, I will read the instructions more carefully.
