PMR:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program took me a very long time to do as I forgot to use the interger.minValue and it took a lot of trial and error to get 
the loops right. Also, I could have used a loop to count how many columns but I didn't realize this and actually counted
how many columns there were in the text file which wasted time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
I will continue to practice as this program took me a long time.
