------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
I feel comfortable using BlueJ and have no problem navigating and using the software. However, while making this
program I made a lot of syntax errors mainly because I often forgot to put a semicolon in the end of my print statement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future: 
I should continue practicing so that I will reduce my syntax errors and will feel more comfortable writing Java. 
I especially need to practice using print and println as I still get confused with their difference. 
One thing I don't really understand is the purpose of using "public static void main(String[ ] args)".
