PMR:
Overall, I found this assignment not too hard as it was a review of the topics I learned in module 3
which I have been practicing a lot recently. I think I did this assignment a lot quicker than previous ones
since I wrote a good pseudocode which made it easier for me as I wrote the statements down. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
One concept I am still unsure about is parseint() and parsedouble() as I haven't really practiced
using these statements. I should go back to 3.08 and try to learn how to use them.
