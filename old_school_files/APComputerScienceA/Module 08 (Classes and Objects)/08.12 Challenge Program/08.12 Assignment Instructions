08.12	Assignment Instructions



Instructions: Write a program that models a real-world scenario.

1.	Create a 08.12 Assignment project in the Mod08 Assignments folder.
2.	Read the instructions carefully before you attempt the assignment.
3.	Create a pseudocode algorithm before you begin coding.
4.	Using a word processor, create a class diagram for the class.
5.	The program should be written in OOP format using at least one implementation class and one client tester class.
6.	Choose a previous project to convert to OOP format. Suggestions include the Hurricane or Darts projects. If you have another idea, seek instructor approval.
7.	The object implementation class needs to contain:
  a.	private instance variables
  b.	at least one constructor
  c.	mutator methods
  d.	a toString() method
  e.	getter methods

8.	In the client class, use a data structure, either an array or an ArrayList, to organize instances of the object.
9.	A minimum of 10 different objects should be used in this simulation.
10.	As appropriate, provide summary information for your simulation, such as minimum, maximum, total, or average values.
11.	Print the results in a user-friendly format. Usually a table with the data neatly displayed is appropriate.
12.	Properly document all sections of code.
