PROJECT TITLE:
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Revise the Calculation V5 to replace all decimal values with double variables
VERSION or DATE: June 19, 2019
AUTHORS: James Young

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
After some practice, I found it easy to remember how to use concatenation and I feel a lot more comfortable
writing arithmetic expressions now. However, I kept making one syntax error which was that I forgot to put two brackets
after writing my equation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future: 
I should continue to practice using double variable and integer variable
so that I can be more familiar with it. Also, I think I should give my variables a more meaningful
name as it will be helpful in the future when I have more variables to use.
