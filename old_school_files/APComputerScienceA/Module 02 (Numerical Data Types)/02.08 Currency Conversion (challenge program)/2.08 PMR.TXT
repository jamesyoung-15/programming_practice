------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
I found the currency conversion part relatively easy as I followed the example given and was able to learn off of it really quick.
However, I struggled most with the souvenir portion as using casting, division, and modulus makes it much harder.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
I should continue practicing casting and modulus so that I will eventually be familiar with it and won't struggle with it anymore.
