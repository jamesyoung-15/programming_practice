PMR:
After completing this assignment, I think I understand how to use boolean data types and can now use
if-else-if statements. One issue I ran into was that I forgot to use parseDouble to convert my string 
to a double when I asked the user for their height. It took me a while to figure this one out but after looking
through some of the old examples from previous lessons I figured it out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
I will continue practicing if-else-if statements so that I am comfortable as I forgot to put { 
when I was typing the if-else-if statements.
