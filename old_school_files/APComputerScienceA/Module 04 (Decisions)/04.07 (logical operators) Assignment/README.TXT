------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
This assignment took me a while to do as I struggled with making the program work
for both upper and lower case. Also, I forgot to use the char data type so at first
my program didn't work.

In the Future:
I will work more on using char data types and practice making single character user input
programs.
