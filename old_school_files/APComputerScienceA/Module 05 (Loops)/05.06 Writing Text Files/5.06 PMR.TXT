PMR:
While writing this program, I ran into a couple of problems and mistakes. For example,
I forgot to put in.close(); at the end of my program and I also forgot about the IOException
at the beginning. It took a lot of testing for me to fix the mistakes in my program, but 
I eventually edited and made my program run as I intended it to.

In the Future:
A lot of the mistakes I made could've been avoided if I had written a more detailed pseudocode
so this is something I will try to fix next time.
