------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMR:
At first, I started off writing this code well as I had written a decent pseudocode beforehand.
However, when creating my fourth option on the menu, I struggled to make it only numbers and letters
as I'm not sure how to exclude some of the brackets and other symbols (ASCII 91-96 and 58-64) and it took me a long 
time to figure it out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Future:
I should continue practicing loops and ASCII programs as I still feel a bit uncomfortable using them.
Also, looking back I should've also put a maximum on the password length to make this more realistic.
